# emacs-mac work branch, which is --HEAD:
# https://bitbucket.org/mituharu/emacs-mac/branch/work

# Check what options an existing install used: see var system-configuration-options

# - Don't use glib: https://emacs.stackexchange.com/a/21463/2163
# - Not sure if using gnutls (the default) is the right thing to do or not.
# - Not sure whether using lib-xml2 is the right thing to do or not.
# - --with-no-title-bars sounds nice but makes it difficult to move window if toggled to less than fullscreen
# - Support loading dynamic modules.
#
# Fresh install:
brew install emacs-mac \
     --with-modern-icon \
     --with-imagemagick \
     --with-dbus \
     --with-modules \
     --with-xml2 \
     --HEAD

# Reinstall with same options as last install:
# brew reinstall emacs-mac

# Alternative package: https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus
